# Volcano Map
Volcano map is a lightweight map-drawing project that makes use of the folium and pandas libraries to draw a map from json data. Pull information to map
populations, and uses pandas for accessing text data from the volcanoes.txt file. It then draws all this with layer control onto a folium map into Map1.HTML.
